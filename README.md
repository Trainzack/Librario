## How to Compile from Source

### Setup the Project

1. [Clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).
2. Install an IDE that has Maven (I use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/), and the rest of this guide is written assuming that's what you're using).
3. In Eclipse, select `File > Open Projects from File System...`.
4. Click the `Show other specialized import wizards` link near the bottom right.
5. Click on `Maven > Existing Maven Projects` from the tree view.
6. Select the root directory of the repository you downloaded. When done right, `/pom.xml` should show up in the Projects list. Make sure it is checked.
7. Hit the "Finish" button, and wait for the project to be imported.
8. Setup the Maven Goals [TODO: finish guide]
